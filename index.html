	<blockquote>I'm based in the south west of England and take pictures and create images using mostly film and analogue cameras. My favourite subjects seem to be shorelines, landscapes, water, and some portraits, but in 2017 I'm looking to broaden the subject matter.<br><br>Most often use a 1974 vintage Olympus OM1 for 35mm work and sometimes a Canon Ixus 900Ti for digital pictures. You may also see pictures taken on an Olympus Trip 35mm and Zorki 4K. I have a Yashica-Mat waiting for a CLA so i can do some medium format work.<br><br>i am an amateur and very much still learning. In 2017 I started developing black and white photographs at home in a Patterson tank. My goal for 2017 is to have some prints in an exhibition; although time is running out for this goal!</blockquote>
